This project explores the relationship between phytoplankton biomass, nitrate and nitrite dissolved concentrations, and phytoplankton cell abundance in the Pacific Ocean along a transect from the Gradients 5 cruise held in January to February of 2023 on the R/V Thompson. 

Data Sets can be downloaded here:
https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/Influx_Underway_Gradients_2023v1_0
https://simonscmap.com/catalog/datasets/Gradients5_TN412_NutrientsUW

Instrument: Flow cytometer (BD influx cell sorter) 
Collection Method: Unfiltered seawater from the CTD rosette in HDPE or polypropylene bottles and immediately frozen. 
NO3 + NO2 determined colormetrically on a SEAL Analytical Autoanalyzer (AA3 with HR detectors), except NO2+NO3 that is <0.5umol/L, which is analyzed by chemiluminescence.Â 
When/Where: Simon CMAP Gradients 5 Cruise
Limitations: Seasonality, Irregular resolution, ~5m depth

Research Question: What is the relationship between [NO3 + NO2] and Phytoplankton Biomass?

HA: Expect to see Synechococcus has more dependence on [NO3 + NO2] than Prochlorococcus5

H0: Neither has dependence on [NO3 + NO2]
